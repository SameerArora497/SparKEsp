PluginLoader is a tiny system to dynamically load apk in Android. I used it in many occasions during my development work. I got inspirations from Magisk's Stub app.

## Features
- Able to Download plugin from remote location using REST apis
- Only crafted plugin apks are supported(refer 'app' module)
- Can load resources from plugin apk
- Activity and Service are working
- It supports Android 5.0+

## Achieved So Far
- Spark Esp Switch, Radio Button & Seekbar
- Basic Esp Ui
- Kuro Based Login System

## Notes
- Not every device may supported directly, Modification may need.

## How to Build
- Use Android Studio to build it.
